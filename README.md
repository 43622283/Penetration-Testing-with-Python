## What is this book about?
With the current technological and infrastructural shift, penetration testing is no longer a process-oriented activity. Modern-day penetration testing demands lots of automation and innovation; the only language that dominates all its peers is Python. Given the huge number of tools written in Python, and its popularity in the penetration testing space, this language has always been the first choice for penetration testers.

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* Get to grips with Custom vulnerability scanner development
* Familiarize yourself with web application scanning automation and exploit development
* Walk through day-to-day cybersecurity scenarios that can be automated with Python
* Discover enterprise-or organization-specific use cases and threat-hunting automation
* Understand reverse engineering, fuzzing, buffer overflows , key-logger development, and exploit development for buffer overflows.

```
a=44
b=33
if a > b:
print("a is greater")
print("End")
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a security consultant , developer or a cyber security enthusiast with little or no knowledge of Python and want in-depth insight into how the pen-testing ecosystem and python combine to create offensive tools , exploits , automate cyber security use-cases and much more then this book is for you. Hands-On Penetration Testing with Python guides you through the advanced uses of Python for cybersecurity and pen-testing, helping you to better understand security loopholes within your infrastructure .
